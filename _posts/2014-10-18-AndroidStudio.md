title: Automate android studio installation
---

Automating installation could be really neat in some circumstances such as re-install your laptop env. or for the convenience of new comers in your team, during Friday beer afternoon, i pushed a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jianinz/998c18bcdd44e3378668) on Github to just serve this purpose.

Notice that the version of android studio bundle was hard-coded, since the release tgz package name comes as sort of revision id or git commit hash, so it's quite tricky to get it right, but for now it does its job, so i will just leave it there. Please free feel to use it.
